# net-promoter-score
A net promoter score (NPS) API, that collects users feedback of a determined product.

I designed this NPS system during the Next Level Week, organized by Rocketseat Brasil.

It is designed to send emails to users with a survey for them to evalue. The API manages the feedbacks and stores into the Database.

For it to work, just execute a "yarn" command, all the external libraries will be installed and the application is ready to go!

<code>
  yarn
</code>
